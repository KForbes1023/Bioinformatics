I could not figure out how to add text under the file labeled "img4assngm7" so here is the description seperately 
The image illustrates a section of chromosome 3 in N. whitei. There are multiple layers of genomic information present, starting with the red peaks, which represent RNA-seq data that shows active gene expression telling which genes are being transcribed in this area. Next are blue peaks which are areas of open chromatin identified by ATAC-seq, this indicates regions of the DNA that are accessible and may serve as enhancers or other regulatory elements. Followed by the purple arcs which come from Hi-C data, illustrating 3D genome interactions where distant segments of DNA physically loop together. Overall, this image illustrates how genome organization and gene activity is linked.
